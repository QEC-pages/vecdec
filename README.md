# vecdec - vectorized decoder and LER estimator

## Overview 

The program can do several kinds of calculations depending on the value of the
`mode` command-line argument:

- `mode=0` Run a vectorized Random Information Set decoder using the
  error data generated by the program itself or externally generated
  (e.g., using `Stim`).  See the [Vectorized decoder](#vectorized-decoder) section.
- `mode=1` Run belief propagation decoder.  See the [BP decoder](#bp-decoder) section
- `mode=2` Estimate logical error rate by enumerating most likely errors.  See
  the [LER estimator](#ler-estimator) section.
- `mode=3` Parse the DEM file and save the corresponding matrices to
  files.  See the [Export the matrices](#export-the-matrices) section.
  
In any mode, the program requires the parity check matrices and error
probabilities, e.g., as given in a Detector Error Model (DEM) file,
see the [Error model](#error-model) section.

For additional details, see the [section](#-all-command-line-arguments) on
command-line arguments, the source code in `vecdec/src` directory, and example
scripts in `vecdec/examples` and `vecdec/input` directories.


## Installation 

The program uses `m4ri` library for binary linear algebra.
To install this library on a Ubuntu system, run
    `sudo apt-get install libm4ri-dev`
    
To run scripts in `vecdec/examples` directory, you will need to install
command-line versions of [Stim](https://github.com/quantumlib/Stim) and
[PyMatching](https://github.com/oscarhiggott/PyMatching).
    
For compilation *help*, change to the (vecdec/src/) directory and just run w/o
arguments  
    `make`
Since the program  is experimental, I recommend compiling with  
    `make vecdec EXTRA=""` 
This will enable additional integrity
checks, and a lot of optional debugging information.

## Error model

A detector error model (DEM) is a collection of independent `events`, each of
which is characterized by a probability `p`, a list of affected syndrome bits,
and a list of affected codewords.  Can be created by `stim`, see shell scripts
in the (vecdec/examples/) directory.  Notice that `stim` cycles are not
supported in the DEM file.  Only the lines starting with `error` are used; the
`detector` and `shift_detectors` are silently ignored, as well as any comments.
Any other entry will trigger an error.

```
# An example DEM file created by `stim`
error(0.125) D0
error(0.125) D0 D1
error(0.125) D0 D2
error(0.125) D1 D3
error(0.125) D1 L0
error(0.125) D2 D4
error(0.125) D3 D5
error(0.125) D4 D6
error(0.125) D5 D7
detector(1, 0) D0
detector(3, 0) D1
shift_detectors(0, 1) 0
detector(1, 0) D2
detector(3, 0) D3
shift_detectors(0, 1) 0
detector(1, 0) D4
detector(3, 0) D5
detector(1, 1) D6
detector(3, 1) D7
```

Alternatively, the error model can be specified in terms of CSS
matrices `H=Hx` and `L=Lx` (use command-line parameters `finH=` and
`finL=` to provide the file names).  For a quantum code, instead of
`L`, the dual CSS generator matrix `G=Hz` can be given.

All matrices with entries in `GF(2)` should have the same number of
columns, `n`, and obey the following orthogonality conditions: $$
H_XH_Z^T=0, \quad H_XL_Z^T=0, \quad L_XH_Z^T=0, \quad L_XL_Z^T=I,$$
where $I$ is an identity matrix.  Notice that matrix $L_Z$ is not used
by the program and it cannot be set.

The program can read matrices from files in sparse (`coordinate`)
MaTrix market exchange (`MTX`) format and David MacKay's `alist` format. 


## Vectorized decoder

This section describes operation with the command-line switch `mode=0`
(the default).

### How it works 

Given a binary vector `s` with detector events, the goal is to construct the
most likely binary vector `e` such that `H*e=s`.  The decoding is verified by
computing the vector of observable bits `L*e` and comparing it with the
corresponding result computed from the actual error.

The random errors and the corresponding detector/observable vectors can be
generated on the fly (for a given error model), or read from files in 01
format.

The program processes up to `nvec` syndrome vectors at a time.  The syndrome
columns are written as columns of a binary matrix `S`.  The original check
matrix `H` (extracted from the error model) is combined with `S`, to form
block-matrix `[H,S]`.  At each step, a column ordering `P` is randomly generated
(using values of event probabilities to help), the Gauss elimination is
performed on the rows of the combined matrix, creating the list of pivot columns
`[i0, i1, ...]`, with one entry per row.  Given the transformed syndrome column
`[s0, s1, ...]`, the output vector has values given by the list of pairs
`[(i0,s0), (i1,s1), ...]`.  The energy is calculated as the sum of LLRs for
non-zero bits in `e` and recorded, along with the sparse form of `e` if the
energy is small enough.

The program stops after a sufficient number of attempts is made, and compares
the values `L*e` for each found error `e` with the similar ones generated from
the original errors; any mismatch is a logical error.

### How to run it

The `suggested` number of syndrome vectors to generate and process is given by
`ntot`.  In reality, the number of rounds is calculated as $\lceil$ `ntot/nvec`
$\rceil$, where `nvec` is another command line argument (currently, the default
`nvec=16`, although one should probably use at least `1023` for efficiency).  In
each round, `nvec` different syndrome vectors will be generated and processed.
Ideally, `nvec` should be a factor `64`, since 64-bit integers are used to store
binary vectors internally.

The parameter `nfail`, when non-zero, will cause execution to stop after
accumulating a given number of logical errors.

The parameter `lerr`, when non-zero, specifies the maximum number of non-zero
error bits outside of the index set to try before generating a new permutation.
This is similar to OSD level.

Another important command-line parameter is `steps`.  It should be set to a
large number (experiment!) for decoding to be accurate, especially close to the
threshold.  The related parameter `swait` (if non-zero) specifies the number of
steps w/o any updates to any error vector to wait before terminating the cycle.

Use `debug=0` to suppress any output except for simulation results.
Use `debug=1023` to output all possible debugging information (not all
bits are used at this time).  The default value `debug=1` causes the
program to print information about basic steps of the calculation.

Use `fdem=filename` (with or without quotes) or `fdem= filename` (with
a space) to specify the input file with the detector error model.

You may also want to set the names of the input files with externally
generated errors, e.g., using the command-line arguments 
`fdet=dets.01 fobs=obs_flips.01`

## BP decoder 

Activate it with the command-line parameters `mode=1`.

When the program is compiled with `USE_QLLR` (the default), parameters
of integer-based Quantized LLR module can be set using `qllr#=ubt`,
where `#` can be 1, 2, or 3.  By default, the recommended values
`qllr1=12 qllr2=300 qllr3=7` are used.  

The power `1<<qllr1` determines how integral LLRs relate to real LLRs
(`to_double=(1<<qllr1)*int_llr`).  Table resolution is `2^(-(qllr1-qllr3))`.
The parameter `qllr2` is the number of entries in a table for LLR
operations.  With `qllr2=0` (no table), a `Min-Sum` algorithm is used,
otherwise a `Sum-Product` algorithm.

## LER estimator

This section describes operation with the command-line switch `mode=2`.

Given the error model, i.e., the matrices $H$, $L$, and the vector of column
probability values $p_i$, the program tries to enumerate the likely binary
`codewords` $c$ such that $He=0$, $Le\neq0$, 
while the associate log-likelihood probability ratio (LLR) 
$\sum_i c_i \ln(1/p_i-1)$
is not too large. 

In fact, right now it just tries to find the single most likely codeword $c$ and
outputs an estimate of the corresponding contribution to the logical error
probability, $$\prod_{i\in \mathop{\rm supp}c} 2[ p_i(1-p_i)]^{1/2}.$$

## Export the matrices 

This section describes operation with the command-line switch
`mode=3`.  In this case the program does not try to run anything and
just parses the DEM file and saves the corresponding parity-check `H`,
observables `L` matrices and the error-probabilities `P` vector.  In
addition, the program constructs the `G` matrix (whose rows are
orthogonal to rows of `H` and `L` matrices and the total rank equals
to `n`, the number of columns in these matrices).

The matrices are written in the Matrix Market format to files with names
`${fout}H.mmx`, `${fout}G.mmx`, `${fout}L.mmx`, and `${fout}P.mmx`,
where the header string is defined by the value of the `fout=`
command-line argument.  An exceptional value is `fout=stdout`, in
which case the contents of the files is directed (surprise!) to
`stdout`.

**Note:** For some obscure reasons, the constructed `G` matrix will
 only have weight-3 rows.  This is done by finding triplets of columns
 in matrices `H` and `L` which sum to zero.  This works for a DEM file
 created from a circuit which contains one- or two-qubit depolarizing
 noise.  With insufficient rank in weight-3 rows, the program will
 currently fail.

```

## Libraries 

The program uses `m4ri` library for binary linear algebra.  To install
under Ubuntu, run
```
sudo apt-get update -y
sudo apt-get install -y libm4ri-dev
```

`Tiny Mersenne Twister` written by Mutsuo Saito and Makoto Matsumoto
is used for random number generation (header file `src/tinymt64.h` is
included with the distribution).

`uthash` by Troy D. Hanson and Arthur O'Dwyer is used for hashing
storage (header file `src/uthash.h` is included with the
distribution).

Shell scripts in the `examples/` directory assume command-line
versions of `PyMatching` and `Stim` packages compiled and located in
`../PyMatching` and `../Stim` (with respect to the location of this
file).  These excellent packages written by Oscar Higgott and Craig
Gidney, respectively, are available from `GitHub`. Please refer to the
documentation of these packages for the installation instructions.

## Future

Eventually, more sophisticated algorithms will be added to the
program.  Currently in the works are serial BP decoder and stat-mech
maximum-likelihood decoder, as well as some degeneracy-reducing matrix
transformations for `mode=3`.
